CSS Notes:

image websites:

- unsplash, lorem picsum, font awesome, font awesome cdn paste as stylesheet, google fonts

Flex-grow:

- flex-grow:1 -- will make the element to fill all the place except the selected place  by another element
- flex-basis:100px -- make sure the width of the flex doesn't come below the specified value     
- flex-basis:33% -- will taken as 33% since already the container contains the padding and margin

**Flex-basis will only work if flex-wrap is defined in the container
